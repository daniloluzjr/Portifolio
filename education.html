        <p class="texto">My teaching career began in 2006 when I entered the College of Physical Education, developing a passion for helping others learn and grow through movement and health. Over the years, I gained experience teaching in schools, universities, and fitness centers, refining my ability to connect theory with real-world practice. Academically, I hold degrees in Education and a Master’s with Postgraduate specialization in Biomechanics of Physical Activity and Health. By 2020, I had progressed to the position of University Professor, teaching subjects related to anatomy, physiology, and movement science to future healthcare and education professionals. These experiences have strengthened my commitment to education and to inspiring the next generation of professionals in the health and wellness fields.</p>
