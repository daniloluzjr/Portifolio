            <p class="texto">I embarked on my healthcare career at YMCA College of Physical Education in 2012. I pursued postgraduate studies in Biomechanics of Physical Activity and Health, and later earned a Master's degree alongside esteemed research scientists. I contributed to over 5 published scientific articles and completed 20+ university extension courses to enhance my knowledge.

                As a personal trainer, I coached different types of people, from people with pathologies to even athletes. I taught Physical education to children and teenagers in a Public schools and later I became a Professor at Anhanguera College, teaching aspiring physiotherapists, nurses, and physical education teachers.
                
                During the pandemic, I worked in hospitals in Brazil, witnessing the importance of teamwork and dedicating myself to patient care. I then worked as a Caregiver in Ireland, providing personalized support to individuals on their recovery journeys. Currently, I am devoted to caring for the elderly in Portugal, utilizing my knowledge to create a nurturing environment.
                
                Furthermore, I am pursuing studies in Information Technology to develop innovative applications and solutions for the healthcare field.
                
                With a career shaped by diverse experiences and a commitment to growth, I am ready to tackle healthcare challenges and promote well-being worldwide. Thank you for reading a part of my story. Please feel free to contact me for further details.
