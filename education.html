            <p class="texto">I began my healthcare career at YMCA College of Physical Education in 2012, pursuing postgraduate studies in Biomechanics and earning a Master's degree. I contributed to 5+ published scientific articles and completed 20+ extension courses. As a personal trainer, I coached diverse clients from pathological cases to athletes. I taught Physical Education in public schools and became Professor at Anhanguera College, instructing future physiotherapists, nurses, and PE teachers. During the pandemic, I worked in Brazilian hospitals, then as a caregiver in Ireland, and currently care for elderly in Portugal. I'm also pursuing IT studies to develop innovative healthcare applications. Ready to tackle healthcare challenges worldwide and promote well-being through diverse experience and continuous growth.</p>
