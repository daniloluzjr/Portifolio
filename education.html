        <p class="texto">My educational journey began in 2006 when I entered the College of Physical Education, where I developed expertise in teaching across schools and fitness centers. This foundation was further enriched by international experience teaching soccer in Australia, broadening my cultural and pedagogical perspectives.

Academically, I hold a degree in Pedagogy and a Master's degree with Postgraduate specialization in Biomechanics of Physical Activity and Health. By 2020, I had advanced to the position of University Professor, educating future physiotherapists, nurses, and physical education teachers.

My career has taken me across three continents: I've worked in hospitals in Brazil, served as a caregiver in Ireland, and currently provide specialized care for the elderly in Ireland. This international healthcare experience has given me unique insights into different healthcare systems and cultural approaches to patient care.</p>
