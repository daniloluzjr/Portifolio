        <p class="texto">My educational journey began in 2006 when I entered the College of Physical Education, where I developed expertise in teaching across schools and fitness centers. This foundation was further enriched by international experience teaching soccer in Australia, broadening my cultural and pedagogical perspectives.

Academically, I hold a degree in Pedagogy and a Master's degree with Postgraduate specialization in Biomechanics of Physical Activity and Health, credentials that have shaped my comprehensive understanding of human movement, education, and wellness. By 2020, I had advanced to the position of University Professor, where I had the privilege of educating future physiotherapists, nurses, and physical education teachers, combining my academic qualifications with practical teaching experience.

My career has taken me across three continents: I've worked in hospitals in Brazil, served as a caregiver in Ireland, and currently provide specialized care for the elderly in Ireland. This international healthcare experience has given me unique insights into different healthcare systems and cultural approaches to patient care.

Today, I continue to apply my extensive background in education, biomechanics, and international healthcare experience to create solutions that address global healthcare challenges and improve patient outcomes.</p>
