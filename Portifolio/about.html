            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">I am a Master Professor in Physical Education, I have been working for over 10 years in the health area as a Healthcare Assistant. I've had the opportunity to work and study in Ireland and nowadays I'm live in Portugal. My first job a few years ago was Help Desk Support, I really enjoyed working in this area but life took me to a different path and I studied and worked in the health area. 
                I worked in schools and was a College Professor teaching sports and patient care before I left Brazil.

            <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">
                Nowadays I'm studying Systems Analysis and programming and I'm looking for a new opportunity to return to the IT area. Thus, I can add the knowledge of all the areas in which I studied to develop more complete applications according to the companies' needs. I'm hardworking and have a passion for learning.
Looking forward to hearing from you so I can detail the information about my career.</p>
