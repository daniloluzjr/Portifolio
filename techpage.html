        <p class="texto">My passion for computers began with a 486, sparking a lifelong fascination with technology. After studying Computer Science and facing academic challenges, I redirected my path toward healthcare, where I strengthened my communication and problem-solving skills. In the 2000s, I worked in helpdesk support, managing tickets and servers, and learning the value of organization and teamwork. In 2015, I returned to IT through design, creating logos, invitations, and business cards. Since 2023, I have fully reentered the tech field, graduating in Systems Analysis and advancing my skills at Alura Dev School. Focusing on HTML, CSS, and MySQL, I now develop digital health applications at LuxSolutions.tech, where technology meets care to improve lives. Always open to collaboration and innovation opportunities.</p>
