            <p class="texto">My passion for computers began with my first encounter with a 486, igniting a lasting fascination with technology. I dove into courses on MSDos and Windows, but found the challenges of Algebra and Calculus during my Computer Science studies frustrating. This led me to redirect my path towards the healthcare field, where I developed strong communication and empathy skills.

                As a helpdesk support in the 2000s, I spent a rewarding year opening and tracking support tickets, while also caring for servers. This experience taught me the importance of organization and teamwork. In 2015, I returned to IT, focusing on creation and design. I specialized in various projects, such as logo design, wedding invitations, caricatures, and business cards, exploring endless creative possibilities.
                
                Now in 2023, I've reentered the IT field with determination, studying System Analisys and sharpening my programming skills at Alura Dev School. With a focus on HTML, CSS, Flutter, and Python, I'm on a path to develop mobile applications. I envision an innovative future where I can combine my passion for technology and healthcare to make a difference.
