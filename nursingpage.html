            <p class="texto">As a nursing technician, I have gained extensive skills and experience in the healthcare field. Since starting my studies in 2016, I have immersed myself in challenging environments of both public and private hospitals, acquiring valuable knowledge and experiencing impactful situations (including Covid-19 times).

                In surgical centers, I played a crucial role as a Assistant Nurse's, providing essential support and diligent care to patients. I also utilized my creativity and graphic design skills to contribute to visual materials and efficiently organize vital information.
                
                My commitment to healthcare led me to achieve a significant milestone as a professor at a renowned institution, where I shared my knowledge with Nurses, Fisios and P Ed students, empowering them to face future challenges with confidence.
                
                In 2021, I sought new perspectives and ventured to Ireland, where I improved the quality of life for home care patients and provided exceptional care to elderly residents in a nursing home.
                
                Currently, in Portugal, my focus is on personalized care in a Nursing Home, providing individualized assistance and creating a welcoming environment for the well-being and quality of life of residents.
                
                With a solid academic background and a professional trajectory filled with challenges overcome, I continuously strive to develop applications that assist caregivers in their daily tasks in Nursing Homes and Hospitals. Thank you for reading a part of my story. Please contact me for further details.
