        <p class="texto">As a nursing technician since 2016, I've gained extensive experience in public and private hospitals, including challenging Covid-19 times. In surgical centers, I served as Assistant Nurse providing essential patient support while utilizing graphic design skills for visual materials and information organization. My healthcare commitment led to teaching at a renowned institution, sharing knowledge with nursing, physiotherapy, and physical education students. In 2021, I moved to Ireland for home care and nursing home experience, then to Portugal focusing on personalized nursing home care. With solid academic background and diverse professional experience, I continuously develop applications to assist caregivers in their daily tasks. Ready to discuss collaboration opportunities.</p>
