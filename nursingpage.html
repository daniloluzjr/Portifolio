        <p class="texto">Since 2016, I have worked as a Nursing Technician, gaining extensive experience in both public and private hospitals — including the demanding period of the Covid-19 pandemic. In surgical centers, I served as an Assistant Nurse, providing essential patient care while also applying my design skills to create visual materials and organize clinical information. My dedication to healthcare led me to teach in higher education, guiding nursing, physiotherapy, and physical education students. In 2021, I moved to Ireland, expanding my experience in home care and nursing homes, and later in Portugal, where I specialized in personalized elderly care. Recently, I completed my Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) course, and I plan to begin volunteering soon with a rescue team in Ireland. Combining a strong academic foundation with hands-on practice, I continue developing digital tools to support caregivers in their daily work and improve the quality of care.</p>
